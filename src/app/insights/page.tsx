    title: "Budget Allocation is Structurally Broken",
    priority: "critical",
    why: "The raw campaign data showed wide variance in spend across channels. We hypothesized that money was not going to channels generating the most valuable customers. A composite score model (35% ROAS · 25% LCR · 25% LTV · 15% Repeat Rate) was built to rank channels on downstream value, not surface metrics. Kruskal-Wallis confirmed LTV differs significantly across channels (H=20.39, p=0.040).",
    findings: [
      "Affiliate consumes 42.7% of budget ($1.12M) but has the lowest ROAS (0.11) and below-average LTV ($65)",
      "Display acquires customers with avg LTV of $75 at only 5.5% of budget — heavily underinvested vs. its quality rank",
      "Paid Search composite score = 0.726 (highest) vs Affiliate = 0.276 (lowest)",
    ],
    recommendations: [
      "Reduce Affiliate from 42.7% → 9.4% (−33pp). Enforce $70 minimum 90-day LTV per affiliate partner.",
      "Reinvest into Paid Search (+15pp), organic Search (+12pp), Display (+12pp)",
      "Do not eliminate Affiliate entirely — its repeat rate (0.34) is above channel average",

    title: "Campaign Quality vs. Surface Efficiency",
    priority: "high",
    why: "ROAS measures immediate return but not whether campaigns attract repeat buyers. K-Means (k=2, silhouette=0.622) clustered campaigns, then we cross-tabulated cluster membership against 90-day customer repeat rate. Campaigns with above-median ROAS but below-median repeat rate were flagged as 'Deceptively Efficient' — they flatter short-term P&L while degrading CLV.",
    findings: [
      "8 campaigns flagged as Deceptively Efficient — primarily Paid Social (5) and Email (2)",
      "MKT2021 is a critical spend anomaly: $999,999 spent, ROAS = 0.009, CPA = $21,277",
      "14% of campaigns show CTR decay after day 14 — creative fatigue",
    ],
    recommendations: [
      "Audit MKT2021 immediately — data error or catastrophically misrun campaign",
      "Add repeat_rate and 90-day LTV as mandatory KPIs alongside ROAS in campaign dashboards",
      "Implement 14-day creative rotation rule for all social campaigns",

    priority: "critical",
    why: "K-Means (k=4, silhouette=0.194) identified 4 behaviorally distinct segments. Differences were validated with ANOVA (F=3,669, p<0.0001) and Kruskal-Wallis (H=1,044, p<0.0001). The Gini coefficient (0.673) quantified revenue inequality. An independent RFM model cross-validated segment quality.",
    findings: [
      "18 Champions generate $24K revenue — more than the bottom 1,000 customers combined ($676)",
      "Gini = 0.673: extreme concentration means top-customer protection is the #1 retention priority",
      "784 Engaged Browsers average 4.7 add-to-cart events but only $38 revenue — checkout friction is the blocker",
      "6 Champions are NOT opted into email — critical CRM gap",

    title: "Lead Conversion & The Discount Myth",
    priority: "high",
    why: "5-model comparison with 5-fold stratified CV AUC identified the best lead scoring model. IPTW causal inference (not raw correlation) was used for discount analysis because reps offer discounts to harder leads, confounding the naive correlation. Pre-model hypothesis tests validated feature relevance before training.",
    findings: [
      "Lead score is the single strongest conversion predictor (importance = 0.129)",
      "Optimal classification threshold: 0.17 (not default 0.50) — minimizes cost at $4,010/cycle",
      "IPTW causal ATE: discounts reduce conversion probability by 0.9pp",
      "Discount uplift varies: Influencer +5.1pp vs Search −7.0pp — channel matters enormously",
    ],
    recommendations: [
      "Prioritize 1,430 High-tier leads with immediate human follow-up; automate Low-tier",

    priority: "medium",
    why: "Product category performance was absent from prior reporting — all revenue was aggregated at the customer level. We decomposed transactions by category (normalized from 9 raw variants to 6) to identify which products drive revenue vs. loyalty vs. returns. Return rates by channel detect whether certain acquisition sources attract mismatched buyers.",
    findings: [
      "Baby: highest revenue ($39.9K), lowest return rate (7%) — hero category",
      "Personal Care: highest first-purchase repeat rate (58%) — the loyalty gateway category",
      "Beverages: lowest revenue ($14.3K), lowest avg price ($33) — strategic review needed",
      "Influencer acquisitions have the lowest return rate (6.6%); Email has the highest (8.9%)",
    ],
    recommendations: [
      "Use Personal Care as the first-order acquisition vehicle — 58% of first-time Personal Care buyers return",
      "Cross-sell Baby products in post-purchase flows (highest AOV, lowest returns)",
      "Review Beverages: premiumize range or reduce marketing investment",

    title: "Retention & Predicted CLV",
    priority: "high",
    why: "Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (borrowed from clinical trial methodology) estimated the time-to-second-purchase distribution. This revealed the retention crisis: median time to second purchase is infinite. The 90-day retention model (Gradient Boosting, CV AUC=0.746) identifies customers at risk before they churn. MLR confirmed AOV as the dominant LTV predictor (R²=0.851).",
    findings: [
      "Only 24.2% of customers repeat within 90 days — Kaplan-Meier shows median time to 2nd purchase is effectively ∞",
      "Repeating customers spend $154 vs $93 for non-repeaters (Mann-Whitney p<0.0001)",
      "High acquisition cost + low first-order revenue = the strongest churn predictor",
      "AOV dominates LTV prediction (MLR R²=0.851) — first basket size is the key lever",
    ],
    recommendations: [
      "Any customer with no second order after 45 days enters automated win-back (not 90)",
      "Maximize first-order basket size through 'starter kit' bundles — AOV drives LTV",
